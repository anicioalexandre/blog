Micro frontends are the next step in the evolution of frontend architectures. By breaking down a large frontend application into smaller, independently deployable units, teams can develop, test, and release features faster.

### Why Micro Frontends?
- **Scalability**: Different teams can work on separate parts of the application simultaneously.
- **Technology Agnostic**: Allows using different frameworks (e.g., React for one part and Angular for another).
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller codebases are easier to manage and debug.

While micro frontends provide many benefits, they also come with challenges, such as ensuring consistent styling and managing shared state. But with the right tools and practices, you can unlock a new level of efficiency in your projects.
