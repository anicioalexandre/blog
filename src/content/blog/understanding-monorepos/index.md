Monorepos have become a popular approach for managing codebases in software development. By hosting multiple projects in a single repository, you can streamline dependency management and foster collaboration across teams.

### Advantages of Monorepos
- **Centralized Management**: All projects share a single repository, making updates easier.
- **Shared Dependencies**: Avoid version conflicts by using consistent library versions.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Teams can easily contribute to and test related projects.

Tools like PNPM and Nx provide robust support for monorepos, offering features like dependency caching and incremental builds. Embrace the monorepo approach to simplify your workflow and improve project scalability.
