Web components are a set of standards that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated UI elements. Unlike framework-specific components, web components work natively in modern browsers.

### Key Features of Web Components
- **Encapsulation**: Styles and behavior are scoped to the component.
- **Reusability**: Create once and use anywhere.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JavaScript.

Web components are becoming increasingly popular as they provide a standardized way to build and share UI components. Start exploring them today to create maintainable and portable designs!
