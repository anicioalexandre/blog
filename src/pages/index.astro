        <h1 class="prose-h1">Hi there, I'm Alexandre!</h1>
        <p class="prose-body1">
          I'm a curious engineer who loves exploring new technologies and hands-on learning. I
          specialize in frontend development with React (and other frameworks), work on mobile apps
          with React Native, and explore backend systems with Python (Django) and DevOps tools like
          Docker and Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <p class="prose-body1">
          This blog serves as both a space for sharing my professional journey and a hub for
          technical insights. Here, you'll find posts about tools and technologies I've explored,
          practical guides, and stories about how I approach challenges in software development.
        </p>
        <p class="prose-h6">Thanks for stopping by—enjoy your stay!</p>
